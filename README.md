# Rust Programming on Coursera

Structured study project for the Rust Programming Specialization from Duke University, delivered through the Coursera learning platform.

## Purpose

This project follows the Rust Programming Specialization from Duke University on Coursera, with the goal of developing practical and well-founded Rust skills for systems programming.

The focus is on understanding and applying Rust’s core strengths—memory safety, performance, and concurrency—through hands-on programming rather than passive
consumption of course material. The specialization spans five courses, covering topics from foundational Rust syntax to more advanced applications such as automation tools, data processing, and selected machine learning workflows.

Work in this repository emphasizes:

- Building and reasoning about real Rust programs
- Applying Rust to realistic systems-level problems
- Producing concrete, reviewable code artifacts rather than certificates

The end goal is not specialization completion alone, but a durable Rust skill set that can be transferred to domains such as systems software, backend development, data engineering, or embedded systems.

## Tooling

Development is done locally using Visual Studio Code and the Rust toolchain. Cloud-based environments and AI autocomplete tools are intentionally avoided to keep the learning process transparent and reproducible.

## Status

In progress.
